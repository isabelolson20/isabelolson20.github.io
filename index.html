        <p>I was born in Stamford, Connecticut but I moved to Summit, New Jersey when I was 3.
            <br>I study communications at the Newhouse school of Syracuse University with a major of broadcast and digital journalism.
            <br>I am currently a freshman.
            <br>I like to ice skate, shop, hang out with friends, and go to the football and basketball games held in the dome.
